# Space Invaders

Space Invaders is a part of the Atari environments, its objective is to destroy the space invaders by shooting
its laser cannon and avoiding shooting targets from the invaders. The agent has six actions, and the optimal
solution is as mentioned before (i.e., to destroy the invaders). We have found an interesting paper published by
Google DeepMind, in which they improved the performance of regular DQN (Deep Q-Network) by 164.11%.
We also found some promising algorithms that worth a shot, such as Keras-RL and PPO-LSTM included in
Stable-Baselines3 community contribution.
